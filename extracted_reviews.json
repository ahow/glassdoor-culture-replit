      "cons": "The management decisions that the company makes are poorly thought out and are seemingly driven by a fear of being tossed aside during the next round of layoffs if \"productivity goals\" are not met. This manifests itself in petty politics and a facade of superficiality that drives the culture. Layoffs have resulted in a number of teams being understaffed and poorly managed and has led to a steadily declining morale among workers who have to handle workloads that are vastly greater than their pay-grade warrants. Employees who are not making six-figures are regularly worked 50-60 hour weeks. These time expenditures are both known of and under-appreciated by management and there have been no efforts to increase hiring to more evenly distribute workloads. It starts off feeling like a great place to work because the free coffee bar and snacks do miracles for propagandizing the quality of the culture, but after a few months it will become abundantly evident where there are pretty serious lapses in how things are run. Outside of culture, the data systems are all over the place and the amount of incongruities that exist in them is astonishing for a $1T+ firm.\n\nBluntly, everyone has their head up their own a-- and efforts to engage in meaningful dialogue or develop a deeper understanding of your role are often met with the attitude that you are being nuisance for attempting to learn and do your job. You are able to learn a fair amount, but primarily through independent work, and you have to be prepared to regularly feel like you are resented by your coworkers for having to perform the tasks that are necessitated by your job. \n\nOne gets the sense of there being a vague, frenetic neurosis that dictates day-to-day workflow even when things aren't that busy and that a very real and ominous discontent often permeates throughout the office.",

      "summary": "A Demoralizing Workplace Where Merit Takes a Back Seat to Politics",
      "pros": "Strong 401(k) and profit-sharing program\nGood health insurance and overall benefits package\nYou\u2019ll likely find one or two genuinely wonderful colleagues who make the experience more bearable",
      "cons": "Toxic Work Culture: The environment is characterized by clawing at one another for survival, where advancement beyond the early-career stage often seems to require undermining colleagues rather than being recognized for merit. On multiple occasions, I was informally recruited for internal opportunities only to learn later that my own director actively sabotaged them\u2014including one instance in which a hiring manager\u2019s assistant disclosed that my director threatened to end their friendship with the hiring manager if they \u201cstole me\u201d from my team.\n\nUndisclosed Layoffs: Although the firm conducted two official RIFs during my six-year tenure, it also carried out an additional several rounds of unreported layoffs across several days. Employees affected were instructed not to disclose that they had been terminated, ostensibly to avoid publicizing the actions or triggering WARN reporting requirements.\n\nLack of Meaningful Professional Development: Unless you happen to have an exceptional manager, \u201cprofessional development\u201d generally amounts to being assigned to projects unrelated to your role, expected to work extensive overtime with minimal guidance, and then watching managers or directors claim full credit for the results. Requests to participate in formal development programs or obtain certifications typically require exhaustive business justifications, only to be delayed for months and ultimately denied with vague statements that \u201cit\u2019s not the right time.\u201d\n\nOut-of-Touch Leadership and CEO: During a panel discussion on career advancement, the CEO cited access to amazing nannies and domestic help as a key factor for succeeding in their career - an especially tone-deaf message given that many non-investment employees earn under $120k and could not reasonably afford such resources. Partners aren't much better, and will often complaining to their reports about out of touch issues (ex: a partner once complained to me he paid 3x my total salary in taxes and waited for sympathy). Also noting that despite Glassdoor listing Brendan Swords as the CEO, he left the firm years ago.\n\nPerformative Niceness: While many employees appear outwardly friendly, the underlying culture is intensely gossipy and often hostile. It is common to hear disparaging or inaccurate remarks about oneself from people you barely interact with, which seems tied to the broader atmosphere of insecurity and survivalism.\n\nUnaccountable Middle Management: Middle management operates with very little behavioral oversight, creating an environment where condescension and unprofessional conduct often go unchecked. Many managers routinely project their own stress and frustrations onto the people they supervise, leading to a climate where employees absorb emotional fallout rather than receiving support or direction. This lack of accountability not only damages morale but also reinforces a hierarchy where poor managerial behavior is normalized.\n\nInconsistent Return-to-Office Policies: The firm introduced a formal process for requesting exemptions from the four-day-per-week in-office policy, requiring employees to undergo an onerous approval process. Only months later, leadership abruptly reversed course and announced these exemptions would no longer be honored, leaving employees scrambling to adjust their personal and family arrangements. If you are friends with a MD or Partner, however, you can get away with showing up rarely. \n\nGendered Expectations for Women: As a woman, it became increasingly clear that success was often tied less to competence and more to conforming to a narrow and problematic standard. Women who were white, conventionally attractive, and willing to engage in permissive or overly accommodating behavior advanced quickly, while those who were BIPOC or who simply delivered strong work without performing this \u201cpersona\u201d were overlooked or sidelined. This dynamic not only created an exclusionary environment but also reinforced inequitable norms that undermined genuine merit.\n\nMass Exodus: Over the past year, the rapid deterioration of the culture has driven many employees to leave, with many roles left unfilled. Those who remain are stretched thin, demoralized, and often staying only in hopes of a future severance package or to bridge the gap to retirement.",

It\u2019s astonishing that a company built on scrutinizing other companies as investments can itself be run with such poor governance and a glaring absence of accountability for poor decisions and mismanagement.\nMid-level managers largely survive by managing up and, more often than not, act as enforcers rather than true leaders.

No one feels secure in their job anymore.\n\nThey've got some good ideas on how to return the company to growth, but they seem to forget they need to communicate these things to their employees. Instead, they say nothing or talk in riddles and then can't understand why morale is low and no one buys into their vision for the future.\n\nYour next opportunity will be decided by a bunch of people in a room who don't know much about you.

Promotions are impossible unless you are amongst the top 2% or a minority that will help their diversity numbers look good (yes, women &amp; people of color/LGBT+ have a good chance). Managers have been asked to fake reviews to make a PIP list and be prepared for additional layoffs, even if the employee is meeting expectations. Trading and Investment teams are obviously more valuable. The Infrastructure group is run poorly as they have very smart people who are not treated unfairly. Some of them are the smartest in the firm but don't get promoted (or mentored) since management is biased.

Player/coach management model doesn't work and there are too many senior department heads who play the game to be promoted vs. having the correct skills to lead/positively change departments.

Offshore dependency creates huge gaps in communication and accountability for security functions that require speed and context. Career advancement is nearly impossible unless you\u2019re aligned with the right political faction, regardless of merit or contribution. The culture rewards survival, not excellence. \n\nAdvertised benefits are also not reliably given. Reimbursements and perks often come with hidden technicalities, and you can spend weeks chasing approvals only to be denied over small procedural details.",

Everything you hear or see is just a smoke screen. If you are honest, committed to your work, and want to build a great product for State Street customers, you will likely face backstabbing and be let go. State Street laid off 20-50-100 talented individuals who had given decades of their careers and lives to the company on whim, not once or twice, but every few months. There were four layoff rounds in 2025 alone, and more seem to be coming. The irony is that the team bringing in a good amount of revenue is penalized to save those who make no real contribution. Consulting companies like Galatia and Deloitte, among others, receive better treatment than hardworking employees with product and industry knowledge. Not sure if someone is getting a kickback from these consulting firms, and be ready to lose your job to consultants any time unless you are good at faking your work and keeping management happy with your hollow talks. Seriously, if you have family or are trying to build a real career, this is not a place for you. Don't get fooled by the pay package. If you don't trust this review, just ask anyone working there, except those involved in the politics.",
